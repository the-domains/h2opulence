            <title><![CDATA[WHAT IS PHYSICAL HEALTH?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>WHAT IS PHYSICAL HEALTH?</h1><p>Physical Health is defined as an essential part of overall health of an individual. We feel as though physical health encompasses internal and external health. You cannot be healthy on the outside if you’re not healthy on the inside. Physical health also includes social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual, and environmental health. All of these factors in your life can have positive and negative effects on your physical state of being. If your physical health is not in good standing, it causes strain, stress, and financial burden not only to yourself, but those close around you. We believe that we have the best gift to address everyone’s physical health to ensure true balance and self healing.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mind Your Mind</h1><p>Mental health refers to your mental state of mind and how it’s been fed through personal development, positive self talk, influential mentors, listening, speaking, learning and coaching. It’s been proven time and time again, that our minds hold the greatest power over our bodies, meaning the way we feel, our attitudes, our perception, and the way we view the world at large. Focusing on mental health is key because it’s so important to not only do physical exercises for our body, but also “push-ups” for the brain. We can never stop learning skills such as, relationship building, confidence, communication, public speaking, leadership, and mentorship. Making an investment into mental health is one of the greatest gifts to take your business and personal life to the next level!Always be sure to “mind” your mind.</p></article>]]></description>
