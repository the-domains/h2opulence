WHAT IS _PHYSICAL HEALTH_?

Physical Health is defined as an essential part of overall health of an individual. We feel as though physical health encompasses internal and external health. You cannot be healthy on the outside if you're not healthy on the inside. Physical health also includes social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual, and environmental health. All of these factors in your life can have positive and negative effects on your physical state of being. If your physical health is not in good standing, it causes strain, stress, and financial burden not only to yourself, but those close around you. We believe that we have the best gift to address everyone's physical health to ensure true balance and self healing.
